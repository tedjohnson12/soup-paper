It is a wide field of view photometer with a Schmidt-type telescope and an array of 42 CCDs covering the 100 sq. deg. Field of View (FOV). It has a 0.95 m aperture and a 1.4 m primary and is designed to attain a photometric precision of 2 parts in 105 for V = 12 solar-like stars for a 6-hour transit duration. It will continuously observe 100000 stars from V = 9 to V = 15 in the Cygnus constellation for a period of four years with a cadence of 4 per hour. An additional 250 stars can be monitored at a cadence of once per minute to address asteroseismology of stars brighter than V = 11.5. The photometer is scheduled to be launched into heliocentric orbit in 2007. A ground-based program to classify all 450000 stars to V = 15 in the FOV and to conduct a detailed examination of a subset of the stars that show planetary companions is also planned.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission is a space observatory launched in 2009 by NASA to monitor 170\,000 stars over a period of four years to determine the frequency of Earth-size and larger planets in and near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars, the size and orbital distributions of these planets, and the types of stars they orbit. Kepler is the tenth in the series of NASA Discovery Program missions that are competitively-selected, PI-directed, medium-cost missions. The Mission concept and various instrument prototypes were developed at the Ames Research Center over a period of 18 years starting in 1983. The development of techniques to do the 10 ppm photometry required for Mission success took years of experimentation, several workshops, and the exploration of many `blind alleys' before the construction of the flight instrument. Beginning in 1992 at the start of the NASA Discovery Program, the Kepler Mission concept was proposed five times before its acceptance for mission development in 2001. During that period, the concept evolved from a photometer in an L2 orbit that monitored 6000 stars in a 50 sq deg field-of-view (FOV) to one that was in a heliocentric orbit that simultaneously monitored 170\,000 stars with a 105 sq deg FOV. Analysis of the data to date has detected over 4600 planetary candidates which include several hundred Earth-size planetary candidates, over a thousand confirmed planets, and Earth-size planets in the habitable zone (HZ). These discoveries provide the information required for estimates of the frequency of planets in our galaxy. The Mission results show that most stars have planets, many of these planets are similar in size to the Earth, and that systems with several planets are common. Although planets in the HZ are common, many are substantially larger than Earth.},

  abstract = {We present the occurrence rates for rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of main-sequence dwarf stars based on the Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalog and Gaia-based stellar properties. We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between \$\{0.37\}\_\{-0.21\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.48\}\$ (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and \$\{0.60\}\_\{-0.36\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.90\}\$ planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between \$\{0.58\}\_\{-0.33\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.73\}\$ and \$\{0.88\}\_\{-0.51\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.28\}\$ planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

  abstract = {Kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally new discoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. The data returned from Kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed, precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extent of high duty cycle observations. As the first mission to provide extensive time series measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a level hitherto possible only for the Sun, the results from Kepler will vastly increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. Here, we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most interest for detection of exoplanets via transits. By design the data from moderately bright Kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental limitations such as Poisson statistics and any instrument noise. The noise levels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50\% the target levels for solar-type, quiet stars. We provide a decomposition of observed noise for an ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (Poisson and readout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the stars. The largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise follows from intrinsic stellar noise. We show that using stellar parameters from galactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation, activity, and hence noise levels reproduce the primary intrinsic stellar noise features.},

Kepler-68d has an orbital period of 580 {\textpm} 15 days and a minimum mass of M Psin i = 0.947 {\textpm} 0.035MJ . Power spectra of the Kepler photometry at one minute cadence exhibit a rich and strong set of asteroseismic pulsation modes enabling detailed analysis of the stellar interior. Spectroscopy of the star coupled with asteroseismic modeling of the multiple pulsation modes yield precise measurements of stellar properties, notably T eff = 5793 {\textpm} 74 K, M sstarf = 1.079 {\textpm} 0.051 M {$\odot$}, R sstarf = 1.243 {\textpm} 0.019 R {$\odot$}, and {$\rho$}sstarf = 0.7903 {\textpm} 0.0054 g cm-3, all measured with fractional uncertainties of only a few percent.

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC{$\approx$}4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

But the invitation can only be accepted if the host star is bright enough for precise measurements of its flux and spectrum. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is dedicated to finding such favorable systems. Operating from a 13.7-day elliptical orbit around the Earth, TESS uses four 10.5 cm telescopes to capture optical images of a 24 x 96 degree field of view. By shifting the field of view every 27 days, TESS can survey most of the sky every few years. In its first six years, TESS has identified approximately 7,000 planet candidates, with several hundred confirmed as planets. Mass measurements of these planets allow astronomers to differentiate between rocky "super-Earths" and gas-rich or volatile-rich "mini-Neptunes," while observations with the James Webb Space Telescope are revealing the secrets of their atmospheres. TESS has discovered planets orbiting a wide range of stars, including young stars, low-mass stars, binary stars, and even a white dwarf star. Beyond planet detection, TESS probes the optical variability of stars and a diverse array of other astronomical objects, including asteroids, comets, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.},

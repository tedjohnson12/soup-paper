The atmosphere of KELT-20 b has been studied extensively via transmission spectroscopy at optical wavelengths, showing strong hydrogen absorption as well as metals including Na I, Ca II, Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I and Cr II. The atmospheric and ionization conditions of this planet may differ from Jupiter-mass exoplanets due to the relatively weak extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star, as the stellar dynamo that generates chromospheric and coronal activity is thought to shut down at spectral types earlier than A4. We present the first spectroscopic observations of KELT-20 b in the far-ultraviolet using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, searching for previously undetected low-ionization and neutral atoms in the upper atmosphere. We find that the FUV transit depth increases with decreasing wavelengths, from \$1.88{\textbackslash}pm0.04\${\textbackslash}\% at 1600--1760 {\AA} to \$2.28{\textbackslash}pm0.04\${\textbackslash}\% at 1410--1570 {\AA}, yielding planetary radii of \$0.1139{\textbackslash}pm0.06\$ \$R\_*\$ and \$0.1222{\textbackslash}pm0.07\$ \$R\_*\$, respectively. We report tentative detections of Fe II and N I at \$2.4{$\sigma\$$} each, and non-detections of C I, S I, Al II, and Si II. We find no evidence for molecular absorption from CO or H\$\_2\$ and no sign of hydrodynamic escape.},

It will continuously observe 100000 stars from V = 9 to V = 15 in the Cygnus constellation for a period of four years with a cadence of 4 per hour. An additional 250 stars can be monitored at a cadence of once per minute to address asteroseismology of stars brighter than V = 11.5. The photometer is scheduled to be launched into heliocentric orbit in 2007. A ground-based program to classify all 450000 stars to V = 15 in the FOV and to conduct a detailed examination of a subset of the stars that show planetary companions is also planned.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission is a space observatory launched in 2009 by NASA to monitor 170\,000 stars over a period of four years to determine the frequency of Earth-size and larger planets in and near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars, the size and orbital distributions of these planets, and the types of stars they orbit. Kepler is the tenth in the series of NASA Discovery Program missions that are competitively-selected, PI-directed, medium-cost missions. The Mission concept and various instrument prototypes were developed at the Ames Research Center over a period of 18 years starting in 1983. The development of techniques to do the 10 ppm photometry required for Mission success took years of experimentation, several workshops, and the exploration of many `blind alleys' before the construction of the flight instrument. Beginning in 1992 at the start of the NASA Discovery Program, the Kepler Mission concept was proposed five times before its acceptance for mission development in 2001. During that period, the concept evolved from a photometer in an L2 orbit that monitored 6000 stars in a 50 sq deg field-of-view (FOV) to one that was in a heliocentric orbit that simultaneously monitored 170\,000 stars with a 105 sq deg FOV. Analysis of the data to date has detected over 4600 planetary candidates which include several hundred Earth-size planetary candidates, over a thousand confirmed planets, and Earth-size planets in the habitable zone (HZ). These discoveries provide the information required for estimates of the frequency of planets in our galaxy. The Mission results show that most stars have planets, many of these planets are similar in size to the Earth, and that systems with several planets are common. Although planets in the HZ are common, many are substantially larger than Earth.},

  abstract = {We present the occurrence rates for rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of main-sequence dwarf stars based on the Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalog and Gaia-based stellar properties. We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define {$\eta\oplus$} as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$} orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that {$\eta\oplus$} for the conservative HZ is between \$\{0.37\}\_\{-0.21\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.48\}\$ (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and \$\{0.60\}\_\{-0.36\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.90\}\$ planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between \$\{0.58\}\_\{-0.33\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.73\}\$ and \$\{0.88\}\_\{-0.51\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.28\}\$ planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is {$\sim$}6 pc away and there are {$\sim$}4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

  abstract = {The search for life on planets outside our solar system will use spectroscopic identification of atmospheric biosignatures. The most robust remotely detectable potential biosignature is considered to be the detection of oxygen (O2) or ozone (O3) simultaneous to methane (CH4) at levels indicating fluxes from the planetary surface in excess of those that could be produced abiotically. Here we use an altitude-dependent photochemical model with the enhanced lower boundary conditions necessary to carefully explore abiotic O2 and O3 production on lifeless planets with a wide variety of volcanic gas fluxes and stellar energy distributions. On some of these worlds, we predict limited O2 and O3 buildup, caused by fast chemical production of these gases. This results in detectable abiotic O3 and CH4 features in the UV-visible, but no detectable abiotic O2 features. Thus, simultaneous detection of O3 and CH4 by a UV-visible mission is not a strong biosignature without proper contextual information. Discrimination between biological and abiotic sources of O2 and O3 is possible through analysis of the stellar and atmospheric context---particularly redox state and O atom inventory---of the planet in question. Specifically, understanding the spectral characteristics of the star and obtaining a broad wavelength range for planetary spectra should allow more robust identification of false positives for life. This highlights the importance of wide spectral coverage for future exoplanet characterization missions. Specifically, discrimination between true and false positives may require spectral observations that extend into infrared wavelengths and provide contextual information on the planet's atmospheric chemistry.},

Clouds and haze introduce a degeneracy between the strength of gaseous absorption features and planetary physical parameters such as abundances. One way to break that degeneracy is via statistical studies. We collect all published               HST               /WFC3 transit spectra for 1.1--1.65               {$\mu$}               m water vapor absorption and perform a statistical study on potential correlations between the water absorption feature and planetary parameters. We fit the observed spectra with a template calculated for each planet using the Exo-transmit code. We express the magnitude of the water absorption in scale heights, thereby removing the known dependence on temperature, surface gravity, and mean molecular weight. We find that the absorption in scale heights has a positive baseline correlation with planetary equilibrium temperature; our hypothesis is that decreasing cloud condensation with increasing temperature is responsible for this baseline slope. However, the observed sample is also intrinsically degenerate in the sense that equilibrium temperature correlates with planetary mass. We compile the distribution of absorption in scale heights, and we find that this distribution is closer to log-normal than Gaussian. However, we also find that the distribution of equilibrium temperatures for the observed planets is similarly log-normal. This indicates that the absorption values are affected by observational bias, whereby observers have not yet targeted a sufficient sample of the hottest planets.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

  abstract = {Kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally new discoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. The data returned from Kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed, precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extent of high duty cycle observations. As the first mission to provide extensive time series measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a level hitherto possible only for the Sun, the results from Kepler will vastly increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. Here, we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most interest for detection of exoplanets via transits. By design the data from moderately bright Kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental limitations such as Poisson statistics and any instrument noise. The noise levels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50\% the target levels for solar-type, quiet stars. We provide a decomposition of observed noise for an ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (Poisson and readout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the stars. The largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise follows from intrinsic stellar noise. We show that using stellar parameters from galactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation, activity, and hence noise levels reproduce the primary intrinsic stellar noise features.},

  abstract = {Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 Kelvin. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres ({$<$} 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO\$\_2\$ features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets' early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push towards higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a "five scale height challenge," to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO\$\_2\$ features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST's excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.},

By quantifying the detectability as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we can constrain the best methods to detect these biosignatures with next-generation telescopes designed for high-contrast coronagraphy. Using 25 bandpasses between 0.515 and 1 {$\mu$}m and a preconstructed grid of geometric albedo spectra, we examined the spectral sensitivity needed to detect these species for a range of molecular abundances. We first replicate a modern-Earth twin atmosphere to study the detectability of current O2 and O3 levels, and then expand to a wider range of literature-driven abundances for each molecule. We constrain the optimal 20\%, 30\%, and 40\% bandpasses based on the effective S/N of the data, and define the requirements for the possibility of simultaneous molecular detection. We present our findings of O2 and O3 detectability as functions of the S/N, wavelength, and abundance, and discuss how to use these results for optimizing future instrument designs. We find that O2 is detectable between 0.64 and 0.83 {$\mu$}m with moderate-S/N data for abundances near that of modern Earth and greater, but undetectable for lower abundances consistent with a Proterozoic Earth. O3 is detectable only at very high S/N data in the case of modern-Earth abundances; however, it is detectable at low-S/N data for higher O3 abundances that can occur from efficient abiotic O3 production mechanisms.},

Up to now, the false positive that has been identified applies to a planet during a hot greenhouse runaway, which is restricted to planets outside the habitable zone (HZ) of the star that are closer to the star. In this paper, we explore a new possibility based on abiotic photogeneration of O2 at the surface of a planet that could occur inside the HZ. The search for such a process is an active field of laboratory investigation that has resulted from an ongoing interest in finding efficient systems with the capacity to harvest solar energy on Earth. Although such a process is energetically viable, we find it to be a very unlikely explanation for the observation of O2 or O3 in the atmosphere of a telluric exoplanet in the HZ. It requires an efficient photocatalyst to be present and abundant under natural planetary conditions, which appears unlikely according to our discussion of known mineral photochemical processes. In contrast, a biological system that synthesizes its constituents from abundant raw materials and energy has the inherent adaptation advantage to become widespread and dominant (Darwinist argument). Thus, O2 appears to continue to be a good biosignature.},

Here, we report the first space-based optical transmission spectrum of the planet using two Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) transit observations from 0.53 to 1.03 {$\mu$}m. We find no evidence for alkali absorption features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0.53 {$\mu$}m. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity ({$\sim$}100-1000{\texttimes} solar), while moderate-metallicity scenarios ({$\sim$}100{\texttimes} solar) require aerosol opacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze models. We find an increase in transit depth around 0.8 {$\mu$}m in the transmission spectra of three different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436b, HAT-P-26b, and GJ 1214b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other instruments may indicate this is not an instrumental effect. Only the transit spectrum of GJ 1214b is well fit by a model with stellar plages on the photosphere of the host star. Our photometric monitoring of the host star reveals a stellar rotation rate of 44.1 days and an activity cycle of 7.4 years. Intriguingly, GJ 436 does not become redder as it gets dimmer, which is expected if star spots were dominating the variability. These insights into the nature of the GJ 436 system help refine our expectations for future observations in the era of JWST, whose higher precision and broader wavelength coverage will shed light on the composition and structure of GJ 436b's atmosphere.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC{$\approx$}4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

  abstract = {The Habitable Worlds Observatory Preliminary Input Catalog (HPIC) is a list of {$\sim$}13,000 nearby bright stars that will be potential targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its search for Earth-sized planets around Sun-like stars. We construct this target list using the TESS and Gaia DR3 catalogs and develop an automated pipeline to compile stellar measurements and derived astrophysical properties for all stars. We benchmark the stellar properties in the HPIC relative to those of the manually curated ExEP HWO Precursor Science Stars list and find that, for the 164 best targets for exo-Earth direct imaging, our stellar properties are consistent. We demonstrate the utility of the HPIC by using it as an input for yield calculations to predict the science output of various mission designs, including those with larger telescope diameters and those focused on other planet types besides Earth analogs, such as Jupiter-mass planets. The breadth and completeness of the HPIC is essential for accurate HWO mission trade studies, and it will be useful for other exoplanet studies and general astrophysics studying the population of bright nearby stars.},

  abstract = {The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.},

  abstract = {A transiting planet invites us to measure its size, mass, orbital parameters, atmospheric composition, and other characteristics. But the invitation can only be accepted if the host star is bright enough for precise measurements of its flux and spectrum. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is dedicated to finding such favorable systems. Operating from a 13.7-day elliptical orbit around the Earth, TESS uses four 10.5 cm telescopes to capture optical images of a 24 x 96 degree field of view. By shifting the field of view every 27 days, TESS can survey most of the sky every few years. In its first six years, TESS has identified approximately 7,000 planet candidates, with several hundred confirmed as planets. Mass measurements of these planets allow astronomers to differentiate between rocky "super-Earths" and gas-rich or volatile-rich "mini-Neptunes," while observations with the James Webb Space Telescope are revealing the secrets of their atmospheres. TESS has discovered planets orbiting a wide range of stars, including young stars, low-mass stars, binary stars, and even a white dwarf star. Beyond planet detection, TESS probes the optical variability of stars and a diverse array of other astronomical objects, including asteroids, comets, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.},
